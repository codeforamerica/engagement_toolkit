### Catalyze ###
Catalyze is a way to share projects and problems and get them solved.
Catalyze is a spin off of the Engagement Toolkit, and has a more
specific focus on building connections with people who have problems.
We are seeking to understand how real people actually solve problems
and are doing an experimental project where we match people together
to help them actually solve problems.
